about page can be a little blurb about me
anything else will basically try to load a blog
simple header at the top of every page.

TODOS:
- Minify JS
- Handle text
- Include modified/created date in blogs
- Watermark images
- Easy way to include banner images
- Keyboard navigation
- OpenGraph / Twitter meta data
- Accessibility pass
- Caching of resources
- Pull styles.sass/date_script.js into binary (include_str)
- Make compatible rpm/static binary for server deployment
- Blog meta descriptions
- Server side metrics
